Install latest stable release of Rstudio.
Works best in Windows 10.

Download 'Bioacoustics.zip' (325 mb) from Google Drive via this link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1PoEmvz1ayCkT6NLOswZ5shVuzdRdN7fp
Extract to 'Desktop', or wherever convenient.
The archive contains old versions of 'Train_bats.r' and 'Deploy_bats.r' and can either be used 'as is' or updated from Github.

The working directory must be set at the top of 'Train_bats.r'.

setwd() sets the working directory, eg:
setwd("C:/Users/Patrick/Desktop/Bioacoustics")

The working directory MUST include 'Train_bats.r', 'Deploy_bats.r', a directory called 'data' and a directory called 'unknown_bat_audio':

Bioacoustics
          -data (folder)
          -unknown_bat_audio (folder)
          -Train_bats.r
          -Deploy_bats.r

Open Train_bats.r in Rstudio and run.

Training should take about 2 minutes and the final output look like this:

                 NO         YES
NATTERERI 0.5955556 0.404444444
C_PIP     0.6933333 0.306666667
PLECOTUS  0.9484722 0.051527778
S_PIP     0.9978056 0.002194444
NOCTULA   0.9992500 0.000750000

The unknown bat is probably a Nattereras !!!!
Why is the probability so  low?
.... Have a look at the spectogram of the unknown / unseen file on Audacity and you'll see that it's quite faint, but also quite typical of recording a medium distant bat.

To classify your own bat call, copy and paste one (and only one) bat audio recording into the 'unknown_bat_audio' directory.
There should only ever be one audio file in that directory at a time, so be sure to delete the original one.
The recording should be 'full spectrum' ie something like 384Kb per second or 192 KHz, mono in '.wav' format.
