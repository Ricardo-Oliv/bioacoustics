Install latest stable release of Rstudio.
Works best in Windows 10.

Download 'Bioacoustics.zip' (325 mb) from Google Drive via this link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1r-6PD5r4luXMWMxx8i1h0_-Cvi0E7o7N
Extract to 'Desktop', or wherever convenient.
The archive contains old versions of 'Train_bats.r' and 'Deploy_bats.r' and can either be used 'as is' or updated from Github.

The working directory must be set at the top of 'Train_bats.r'.

setwd() sets the working directory, eg:
setwd("C:/Users/Patrick/Desktop/Bioacoustics")

The working directory MUST include 'Train_bats.r', 'Deploy_bats.r', a directory called 'data' and a directory called 'unknown_bat_audio':

Bioacoustics
          -data (folder)
          -unknown_bat_audio (folder)
          -Train_bats.r
          -Deploy_bats.r

Open Train_bats.r in Rstudio and run.

To classify your own bat call, copy and paste one (and only one) bat audio recording into the 'unknown_bat_audio' directory.
There should only ever be one audio file in that directory at a time, so be sure to delete the original one.
The recording should be 'full spectrum' ie something like 384Kb per second or 192 KHz, mono in '.wav' format.
